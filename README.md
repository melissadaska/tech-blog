## Description

This week we built a CMS-style blog site similiar to a Wordpress site where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developer's posts as well. It uses handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and express-session npm package for authentication.

This is very useful for a developer who writes about tech and wants a CMS style blog site so that they can publish articles, blog posts, and their thoughts and opinions.
