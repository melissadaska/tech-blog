## Description

This week our challenge was to update an existing budget tracker application to allow for offline access and functionality. This allows the user the ability to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. If the user enters a transaction offline, the total should be updated when they're brought back online.

This is very useful for anyone who wants to track their money without an internet or data connection.
